(a). Repetitions (country) are removed for conciseness; populations are reported in thousand with the same precision for consistency; total population is emphasized by using bold font and highlighting in grey; overall readability is maintained by using Arial font and solid lines to separate data, and left-aligning texts while right-aligning numbers.

(b). A single line chart is used to show crime rates. Curves are distinguished by using different colors and legend. The thickness of a line is scaled based on the crime rates over the years (higher rates, larger thickness). The same range of thickness is applied for the four lines.
