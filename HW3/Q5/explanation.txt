The features "horsepower" and "engine-size" are replaced with "compression-ratio" and "engine-location" while other features are kept. Intuitively the new two features should have less impact on the price than the original ones. Consequently, the linear dependency of the price on the selected features is weakened, resulting in worse model predictions.
